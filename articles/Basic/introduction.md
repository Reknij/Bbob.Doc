# What is Bbob
Bbob is serverless blog framework. It's written in C# with Dotnet 6. Inspiration from Hexo. It's not like a static blogging framework in the traditional sense. It's mainly insert js file to index.html to provide api, and website get blogs from the api. Also change publicPath of index.html. So, the blog theme is a normal website. Bbob is no need to render them.
